# codex README
This is an extension that incorporates the openAI's Codex API. By providing the code editor with the API_KEY of openAI Codex you can directly use it within your code files to generate code automatically.

## Features

- This is just an abstraction to the underlying Codex API that was implemented by openAI
- [openai-codex](https://openai.com/blog/openai-codex/) <- Check the following link to understand the specification.

## Requirements

- You are required to have a Codex API key in your possession. 


## Known Issues

- Cannot generate multiple completion for the same piece of code
- The Generated code, is limited by the effeciency of AI

## Possible issues
- Even though you have a API Key the extension might reject it
    ```
    // Key not verified error message might be displayed
    Check:
    - If you have access to davinci-codex through playground
    Fix:
    - If you don't have access: please apply for codex
    - If you do have the access: A simple fix might be to create a new API key from the API keys settings and use that instead
    ```
